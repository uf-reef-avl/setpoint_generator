# list of setpoint diactionaries
# a setpoint dictionary consists of a setpoint position in meters and
# a yaw angle in degrees
waypoint_list:
  [
    {position: [-2.5, 0., -1.2], yaw_degrees: -90}
  ]

# alteratively:
# specify a formatted CSV file
# give a filepath relative to the home directory
# example:
# waypoint_list: "catkin_ws/src/qv_controller/waypoint_files/waypoint_circle_with_yaw.csv"

# how close is "close enough" for the setpoint position
# imagine a sphere around a setpoint with a radius equal to this value
# if the origin of the vehicle's coordinate frame enters this sphere,
# the vehicle is considered to have hit the setpoint
# unit is meters
setpoint_radius_tolerance: 0.4
setpoint_z_tolerance: 0.7
initial_z: -1.2
initial_yaw: -1.57
# fly to each setpoint in waypoint_list this many times
# e.g. if this value is set to 2, the vehicle will fly to each setpoint in
# waypoint_list and then do it again
number_of_cycles: 4

# if this value is true, the vehicle will fly to the first setpoint after
# completing all of the other setpoints
